# BBC News Ramon

**BBC News Ramon** is a mobile apllication for iOS inspired by *BBC News*. The app works on iOS10+ devices and it supports both iPhone and iPad portrait and landscape designs.

BBC News Ramon allows the user fetch headlines and to discover the detailed content. Furthermore, the app also provides a user interaction tracking by sending 'stats' to an analytics backend by tracking the UIViewControllers the user has displayed and by sending elapsed time when fetching headlines from the backend.

The app is coded using Swift 5 and with some of the latest version techniques such as *Result Types*, amongst others. In addition, the code is structured in a way that offers the possibilty to scale easily and to be tested easily using *MVVM*, *Dependency Injection* and *Protocol Oriented Programing*. 

The app also offers a starting set of both Unit and UI tests grouped within differnet Swift files with the possibilty to add more in the future for great *Continuos Integration*.

Thinking about team work, for this demo version I have done what the instructions told me to do. Despite I would have included a strechy header in the HeadlinesViewController i though that task would be assigned to me to another developer with other functionalities.
